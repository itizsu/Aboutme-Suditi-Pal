    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a naturally extroverted and talkative person who thrives on conversations, storytelling, and 
    connecting with people from all walks of life. I love meeting new faces, swapping ideas, and learning something new from every interaction — 
    whether it’s a quick chat over coffee or a long conversation that sparks new insights. Stories fascinate me, and I find joy in sharing 
    experiences that make people laugh, think, or see the world a little differently. Exploring new perspectives, diving into fresh experiences, and 
    discovering little sparks of curiosity everywhere I go keeps me energized and inspired. For me, life is all about learning, growing,
     and connecting with others in ways that leave both me and the people around me a bit brighter than before.</p>

    <h2>My favs</h2>
    <p>I am a lively and versatile individual with a wide range of passions that reflect both my creative and active sides. Sports have always been an integral part of my life, and badminton is one of my favorite ways to stay fit, focused, and energized. The sport teaches me the importance of discipline, strategy, and perseverance, qualities I carry into all areas of my life. Alongside my love for sports, dancing allows me to express myself freely and creatively, connecting my emotions with movement and rhythm.

Travelling is another passion that drives me to explore the world and experience new cultures, cuisines, and perspectives. Each journey I take enriches my understanding of life and inspires me to approach challenges with an open mind. Baking, on the other hand, lets me combine creativity with precision, turning simple ingredients into delightful treats that bring joy to others.

Music is a constant source of inspiration and comfort in my life. I enjoy not only listening to a variety of genres but also singing, which allows me to express my emotions and connect with others in a unique and personal way. Beyond the arts, I am also deeply interested in intellectual pursuits. Participating in debates helps me develop my critical thinking, public speaking, and persuasive skills, and I love engaging in thoughtful discussions on a wide range of topics.

All of these interests come together to define who I am: someone curious, energetic, creative, and always eager to learn and grow. I strive to embrace every opportunity with enthusiasm, whether it’s on the sports court, in the kitchen, on stage, or in a discussion, and I enjoy bringing positivity and passion to everything I do.</p>

    <h2>My Achievements</h2>
    <p>I am a passionate and versatile individual with a wide range of interests and achievements across academics, arts, and sports. My creative side is strongly reflected in my love for art, music, and performance. I have won several accolades in drawing and painting, including being the Regional Level Winner in a National Event on Water Heritage and receiving the 2019 Coloroma Prize at Forum Neighbourhood Mall, where I was awarded a cycle. I have also secured top positions in numerous school-level drawing and comic competitions, which have helped me nurture my imagination and artistic expression.

Beyond art, I actively participate in music and performance activities. I enjoy singing and listening to music, and I was proud to win first place in a beatboxing competition, showcasing my rhythm and creativity in a unique way. Dancing is another passion that allows me to express myself and stay connected to music.

Sports form an equally important part of my life. I enjoy playing badminton for its discipline and focus, but I also take pride in my achievements in team sports. At the intra-school level, I have won a gold medal in basketball and a silver medal in football, experiences that strengthened my teamwork, leadership, and competitive spirit.

In addition, I have a deep interest in intellectual activities, particularly debates, where I enjoy expressing my thoughts, building strong arguments, and learning from different perspectives. Alongside this, travelling, baking, and exploring new experiences continue to broaden my horizons and add joy to my journey.

Altogether, my passions and achievements reflect a balance of creativity, energy, and curiosity. Whether it is through art, sports, music, or debates, I strive to give my best, keep learning, and embrace every opportunity to grow and shine.</p>

    <h2>My Skillz</h2>
    <p>I am a curious and versatile individual with diverse passions that reflect both creativity and problem-solving. Sports, arts, technology, and performance all play a vital role in shaping who I am. I enjoy playing badminton, which keeps me active and disciplined, while also building focus and resilience. My creative side shines through baking, photography, and drawing, where I have been recognized with several achievements, including being the Regional Level Winner in a National Water Heritage Art Event, winning the 2019 Coloroma Prize at Forum Neighbourhood Mall, and securing top positions in various school drawing and comic competitions.

Technology excites me just as much as the arts. I am passionate about coding and web development, where I enjoy solving problems, creating solutions, and experimenting with new ideas. Alongside this, I find joy in Rubik’s cubing, which challenges my logic, speed, and pattern-recognition skills. Music and performance are also close to my heart—I have secured first place in beatboxing and enjoy both singing and dancing as ways to express myself.

Sports and teamwork continue to motivate me, as seen in my gold medal in basketball and silver medal in football at intra-school competitions. These experiences have taught me the importance of collaboration, leadership, and sportsmanship. I also actively participate in debates, which sharpen my communication, critical thinking, and confidence in expressing ideas.

Together, these interests and achievements reflect my love for learning, creativity, and growth. Whether I am coding, playing a match, solving a cube, baking, or creating art, I give my best with enthusiasm and curiosity, always striving to explore new horizons and make the most of every opportunity.</p>
